# Zpdf
## Product Introduction
Zpdf is a PDF document processing platform based on **fine-tuned large language models**, which features professional-level parsing and processing capabilities for special document types such as **complex PDF layouts**, **LaTeX mathematical formulas**, **chemical molecular formulas**, **image tables**, and **watermarked PDFs**. It is suitable for various scenarios including **research**, **education**, and **office work**.

The tool revolves around 4 core functions to provide users with a full-process PDF processing solution:

**1. High-precision PDF to Markdown Parsing and Translation**
- Accurately identify and extract text, formulas, tables and other content from PDFs, and convert them into editable Markdown format with one click to meet the input requirements of large models, while supporting multilingual translation.

</p>

**2. Handwritten Image/PDF Recognition**
- Achieve high-accuracy recognition and digital extraction of non-printed or blurred text content such as handwritten text, handwritten formulas, and handwritten chemical molecular formulas, effectively solving the pain point that handwritten materials are difficult to edit and retrieve.

</p>


**3. Multi-format Bidirectional Conversion (Markdown-centric)**
- Support flexible conversion of Markdown files into commonly used office formats such as Word and PDF, as well as professional typesetting formats such as HTML and TeX, adapting to document output requirements in different scenarios.

**4. Accurate PDF Translation with Original Layout Retained**
- Different from traditional PDF translation, Zpdf strictly replicates the layout structure of the original document during the translation process, making it suitable for professional documents such as academic papers and technical manuals.
